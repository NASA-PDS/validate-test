          This archive contains Kaguya Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (KGRS) corrected and calibrated time-series 
          spectra and ephemerides, pointing, and geometry (EPG) data for the nominal and extended observation 
          periods of JAXA's SELENE (Kaguya) mission.

          The SELENE mission was the Japanese mission to the Moon with a main orbiter “Kaguya” and
          two daughter relay satellites launched on Sep. 14, 2007. KGRS was mounted on the deck of the
          main orbiter. It employed a high-purity Ge (HPGe) crystal as a main detector, and surrounding
          BGO and plastic scintillators as anti-coincidence detectors to reduce backgrounds. The
          Ge crystal was cooled by a Sterling refrigerator. It made close-proximity observations of the
          Moon from Dec. 14, 2007 to Dec. 11, 2008 at the high circular orbital altitude of 100 km, and
          from Feb. 10 to May 28 in 2009 at the low elliptical orbital altitude of ~30 x 50 km.

          KGRS recorded energy spectra of gamma rays in two gain modes simultaneously; high gain (0.1
          to 3 MeV) and low gain (0.1 to 13 MeV), each of which was analyzed by the 13-bit (8192 ch)
          analog-to-digital converter (ADC). While the former has a higher spectral resolution over the
          energy range of radioactive elements, the latter has better statistics and covers the whole energy
          range of major rock-forming elements, including the Fe neutron capture line at 7.6 MeV. The
          accumulation time of each spectrum was 17 s. Both modes of spectra are included in this archive.

          The observation epochs of KGRS consists of three regular measurement periods (Period 1 to 3),
          background measurements, and the annealing of the Ge crystal. The HPGe detector was annealed
          from 16 to 25, December 2008, which improved energy resolution by a factor of two.
          Period 1 and 2 lasted two and five months, respectively, with limited spatial or spectral
          resolutions. Period 3 lasted ~3.5 months (including dead time) with the best spatial and spectral
          resolutions. In addition, spectra from the background measurement when the satellite was flipped
          and the detector faced deep space can be analyzed to estimate the background gamma-ray intensity
          from the satellite due to the exposure to galactic cosmic rays.

          This archive consists of three spectrum files (each corresponding to one KGRS epoch) and one unified
          EPG file. The spectrum files contain a time series of corrected and calibrated pulse height spectra
          acquired by KGRS's HPGe detector in the lunar orbit. In the spectrum files, each row contains the 
          spacecraft clock (sclk) ticks and UTC time corresponding to the end of the accumulation interval 
          (17 s), with the two sets of the 8192-channel HPGe spectra accumulated. In the EPG file, each row
          starts with sclk recorded at the end of the accumulation interval to match spacecraft positions, 
          pointing, and correction factors with the corrected spectra. Note that the UTC time and ephemeris time
          included in the EPG file correspond to the midpoint of the accumulation interval.

          The Kaguya Gamma-Ray Spectrometer Corrected Spectra bundle was created by Naoyuki Yamashita at Planetary
          Science Institute, AZ, USA, with the permission of JAXA and the KGRS instrument PI Prof. Nobuyuki Hasebe.
